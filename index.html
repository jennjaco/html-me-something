                    <p>"Perfectly good" is a relative term when referring to skydiving airplanes. They are always a little iffy, but it's fine because everyone on
                        board has a parachute!

                        This has been made easier (and more affordable) with my dad and brother both being pilots.</p>

                    <h2>8 Everyday Foods Made From Scratch</h2>                   
                    <p class="description"> Cooking is one of my favorite ways to wind down at the end of a long day or relax on the weekend. There's something 
                     therapeutic in taking so many different elements and combining them in new and different ways creating an entirely
                     new and (usually) delicious concoction! Recently, one of my obsessions has been recreating everyday items that we buy at the store. From 
                     making my own pasta, to brewing my own beer, here are 8 things I've recreated: 
                     <figure class="pasta">

                        <img src="images/pasta2.jpeg" alt="Beet Ravioli" width="150" height="200" align="left">

                        <figcaption>Beet and goat cheese stuffed ravioli!</figcaption>
                    </figure> 
                </p>
                    <div>                 
                    <ol type="1">
                        <ul><b>Pasta</b>- if you haven't tried making your own pasta, I HIGHLY recommend it. Kneading the dough is a great way to work through things that 
                            create stress in our lives and it has such a delicious texture, making it a wonderful addition to Chicken Noodle Soup!</ul>
                        <ul><b>Mayonnaise</b> - creating an emulsion with eggs ane oil is tough to get just right, but the creaminess can't be beat!</ul>
                        <ul><b>Cultured Butter</b> - this one is quite a science experiment. By taking cream and a small amount of buttermilk, then letting it sit 
                            at room temperature for a whole week before churning it in a food processor, you get delicious <em>buttery</em> butter.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Pickles (all kinds!)</b> - Working in a Korean restaurant for a year allowed me to make so many different types of pickles and you can't 
                            beat the crunchiness of homemade pickles.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Almond Milk</b> - I can say I did it. But I still buy the stuff at the store. It was too much work with not enough payoff in my opinion.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Hummus</b> - I keep homemade hummus in my fridge almost all of the time. It is so easy to make and cheaper than store-bought!</ul>
                        <ul><b>Mustard</b> - Similar to pickles, making your own mustard can be delicious and wonderful to personalize it to your specific taste.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Beer</b> - Another thing that I don't do often, but it's a fun experiment in my parent's basement!</ul>                       
                    </ol>

                    <h2>7 Places Hiked</h2>
                    <p class="description">Possibly my favorite hobby because it combines travelling and nature, hiking created happiness. Waking up in the morning
                        surrounded by nature and having nothing you have to do that day but walk is truly amazing. Last summer (2019) I spent 2 months 
                        hiking 566 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, which goes from the border of Mexico to Canada through California, Oregon, and 
                        Washington. I had to leave before finishing the full 2,653 miles to the Canada due to an injury, but I have plans to go back, hopefully
                        with a little less snow in the Sierra Nevada mountain range!

                    <h2>6 Miles Run Continuously</h2>
                    <p id="description">While this may not be a list, it's still an accomplishment I'm proud of! I am <em>NOT</em> a runner. I danced 
                    ballet for 15 years, so my knees and ankles have trouble with the pounding created by running. The amount of hiking I 
                    do probably doesn't help either! However, running shorter distances is something I really enjoy. Pushing my body to see How
                    far it can go and what it can do is always an enticing challenge for me.</p>

                    <p>Guadalupe Mountains was actually my first backpacking trip and it was AWFUL. My boots were new so they destroyed my feet on 
                        the rocky terrain. My backpack was way too heavy, mostly with the necessary water for the West Texas desert. 
                        Somehow, I still came out of that experience with a sense of accomplishment and excitemnet that I wanted to find 
                        again!

                    <h2>4 Cities Called Home</h2>
                    <p>I grew up in the Kansas City area, in Leawood. I'm not sure I can TECHNICALLY say that I've lived in France, but I spent a summer staying with a 
                        family while I was learning French in college. They had a daughter my age and when going out with friends you had to either take the Last
                        bus home at midnight (a little early) or wait for the first bus at 5am. Sitting on the steps of the palace where King Louis XIV (who built 
                        Versaille) was born, watching the sun come up over Paris was so amazing. After college, I moved to Austin where I worked as a flight attendant 
                        for a little while and then sold wine. While Austin is absolutely amazing with the live music and atmosphere, the summer was a little too warm 
                        for my liking. I lived in Germany from 2015-2019. I spoke no German when I moved, but after taking intense classes while working in a restaurant,
                        I'm proud to say that I speak German. My family loves to joke about having studied French for 8 years and then moving to Germany. I left Germany
                        to begin hiking the Pacific Crest Trail before ending up back in my hometown!

                    <h2>3 Liters of Beer at Oktoberfest</h2>
                    <div class="column">
                    <p >This is another one that's not a list, but I feel it's important life advice. The limit is 3. Don't drink more than
                        that. At least not before going on the roller coasters. A whole liter of beer also only costs &#8364 11! There was talk of increasing
                        it to 12 and the people would not allow it. As much fun as Oktoberfest is, it is not the best festival I attended in Germany. It was 
                        so touristy! The festival that the Germans flock to is called Bergfest, which happens further north in a town called Erlangen. Germany is
                        full of these festivals all summer long and they all offer their own unique character.

                        sewed many things for me when I was little, and is still an avid knitter. One of my wintertime hobbies is 
                        knitting with my mom while we watch awful Hallmark Christmas Movies. I've knitted a few <b>scarves</b> but also sewed some glorious Hello
                        Kitty <b>pajama pants</b> in home economics during middle school.
